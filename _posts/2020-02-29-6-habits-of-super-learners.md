# 高效学习者的六个习惯

[6 Habits of Super Learners](https://medium.com/personal-growth/6-habits-of-super-learners-63d466a254fd)

## 大量的阅读

21世纪，有效信息是货币，阅读是获取信息最终的途径

> In a world where information is the new currency, reading is the best source of continuous learning, knowledge and acquiring more of that currency.



## 视学习为过程而非目的

学习是一个过程，在过程中会有所收获进而有所进步，要把学习当成进步的手段而非目的

> Super learners value the process. They don’t have an end goal, they seek consistent improvement. They keep mastering new principles, processes, worldviews, thinking models, etc. The “ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated” pursuit of knowledge is important for their maturity.



## 保持开放的思想

保持一种开放、积极进取的思想

> The ability to keep an open-mind, acquire better knowledge and apply it when necessary can significantly improve your life and career.





## 乐于分享

将自己学到分享、教授给其他人，不但能帮助到他人，还能巩固、内化自己学到的东西级，即输入（学习） + 输出（分享）的模式

> The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another. A better way to learn, process, retain and remember information is to learn half the time and share half the time. Example, instead of completing a book, aim to read 50 percent and try recalling, sharing, or writing down the key ideas you have learned before proceeding.





## 保证大脑的健康

通过健康的饮食来锻炼大脑、抑制大脑的衰弱

> Our brains naturally decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if you intervene early, you can slow the decline process — it’s easier to protect a healthy brain than to try to repair damage once it is extensive.



## 适当的休息

通过适当的休息、有节奏的学习来提高学习的效率，如番茄工作法

> Our brains’ neural networks need to time process information, so spacing out your learning helps you memorise new information more efficiently — give your brain enough time to rest and recover.
